# colab_sign_language_prediction
This is a Python script for a real-time sign language recognition system in Google Colab. It uses JavaScript to capture a webcam image, which is then processed and fed into a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model from TensorFlow Hub. The script predicts the object in the image and prints the corresponding label.
